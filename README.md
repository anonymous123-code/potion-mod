Using the brewing stand, one can brew so-called primitive potions.
These have a low concentration of the elements.
While the vanilla potions are primitive potions, too,
there are other ingredients which might contain multiple different elements and are randomized between each world

There will probably be the following essentia:
 - light
 - electricity
 - heat / fire
 - coldness / ice
 - water
 - health
 - impermanence
 - time
 - motion
 - state
 - difference / equivalence / logic
 - messaging
